# D3-challenge
This is my first project using D3. The goal of this was to explore the D3 library and get a better understanding of everything D3 can do. In this project I created a scatter chart using a CSV dataset on health risks facing particular demographics of the population from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). It's a very simple project and was meant as an exploration rather than a full on D3 project. 

In this project I used: JavaScript, D3, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
